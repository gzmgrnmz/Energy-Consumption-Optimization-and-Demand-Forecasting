# Energy-Consumption-Optimization-and-Demand-Forecasting

# Overview
This project analyzes global energy production data to understand trends, correlations, and optimization opportunities in power plants. The dataset includes information about power plant capacities, fuel types, and energy generation over several years.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is global_power_plant_database.csv, which contains the following columns:

country: Country where the power plant is located
country_long: Long name of the country
name: Name of the power plant
gppd_idnr: Unique identifier for the power plant
capacity_mw: Capacity of the power plant in megawatts
latitude: Latitude of the power plant
longitude: Longitude of the power plant
primary_fuel: Primary fuel used by the power plant
other_fuel1, other_fuel2, other_fuel3: Additional fuels used
commissioning_year: Year when the power plant was commissioned
generation_gwh_2013 to generation_gwh_2019: Energy generation in gigawatt-hours for each year
generation_data_source: Source of the generation data
estimated_generation_gwh_2013 to estimated_generation_gwh_2017: Estimated energy generation in gigawatt-hours
